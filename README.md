# overview
Flintt was a react native/firebase app to help people develop a healthier lifestyle by connecting them to their friends and family for motivation and support. I worked on it for roughly 1.5 years but ultimately shut it down. I discontinued it mid-sprint, so some features in the most recent commit are unfinished. 

## features
- phone and email auth
- calendar
- animated progress graphs with emojis for streaks
- profile pic
- progress diary (images)
- feed with friends' activity status and image
- gif reactions
- chat with replies tied to activities
- push notifications
- email activation campaign
